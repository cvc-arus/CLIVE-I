# CLIVE Installation & Setup Guide (Phases 1–3)

Target environment: Ubuntu Desktop 24.04 LTS, Python 3.12.3, Docker + Docker Compose.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose installed
- Python 3.12.3
- `uv` (or `pip`) for Python package management
- NVIDIA drivers + Container Toolkit (for the Ollama GPU reservation, if using GPU inference)
- Git

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cvc-arus/CLIVE-I.git
cd CLIVE-I
git checkout develop
```

## 3. Root Environment File

Create `.env` at the repo root from `.env.example`, which lists every key needed to install the system:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in real values for the keys that `docker-compose.yml` references directly:

- Phase 1/2 PGVector: `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
- Phase 3 mock database: `SIMPRO_MOCK_DB_USER`, `SIMPRO_MOCK_DB_PASSWORD`, `SIMPRO_MOCK_DB_NAME`. Compose builds the mock's `SIMPRO_MOCK_DATABASE_URL` from them, so use URL-safe characters only (no `@`, `:`, `/`, `%`). `docker compose` refuses to start if any of them is unset.

Postgres applies `SIMPRO_MOCK_DB_*` only when it first creates the `simpro-mock-db-data` volume. If you change them later, recreate that volume (section 10).

The `SIMPRO_` client keys can be left at their mock defaults for local development.

All published ports bind to `127.0.0.1` and are reachable only from the host.

## 4. Start the Full Stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This brings up, in dependency order:
1. `postgres` (PGVector) — waits for healthy before `open-webui` starts
2. `simpro-mock-db` — waits for healthy before `simpro-mock` starts (`simpro-mock` has its own healthcheck on `GET /health`)
3. `ollama`, `tika` — no dependencies
4. `open-webui` — depends on `postgres` (healthy), `tika`, `ollama`
5. `simpro-mock` — depends on `simpro-mock-db` (healthy); its container `CMD` runs `alembic upgrade head`, then `python -m simpro_mock.seed`, then `uvicorn` — so the mock is fully migrated and seeded by the time it's reachable

## 5. Verify Phase 1 & 2

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
```

Checks Ollama and the PGVector database respond correctly. Pull a model if needed:

```bash
docker exec -it clive-ollama ollama pull llama3.2
docker exec -it clive-ollama ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Open WebUI: http://localhost:3000

## 6. Verify Phase 3 (Simpro Mock)

```bash
curl http://localhost:8100/health
python scripts/verify-simpro-mock.py
```

`verify-simpro-mock.py` obtains a token, exercises every resource endpoint, and exits non-zero with diagnostics on failure.

## 7. Install `simpro_client` for Local Development

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv/` and installs the package plus the `dev` dependency group.

**Note:** the root `pyproject.toml` defines `[dependency-groups] dev = [...]` (PEP 735 style) rather than `[project.optional-dependencies]`, so `pip install -e ".[dev]"` and `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` warn that there is no `dev` extra and skip the dev dependencies. Use `uv sync`.

## 8. Run the Test Suite

```bash
uv run pytest -q -m "not integration"
```

This runs the offline suite (no live services required). To also run the live mock smoke test:

```bash
docker compose up -d simpro-mock
uv run pytest tests/test_simpro_mock_v2.py -v
```

Test layers and markers are described in `docs/testing.md`.

## 9. Backups

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh
```

Dumps, compresses, and verifies the PGVector database (Phase 2). The mock's database (`simpro-mock-db`) is disposable dev/test data and is not part of the backup strategy — it can always be rebuilt from the seed script.

## 10. Rollback

```bash
docker compose down            # stop all services, keep volumes
docker compose down -v         # stop all services AND remove the named volumes in docker-compose.yml
```

`-v` removes the named volumes declared in `docker-compose.yml` (only `simpro-mock-db-data`, which holds the mock's database). It does not remove the Phase 1/2 bind mounts under `/data/` (`/data/ollama`, `/data/openwebui_data`, `/data/pgvector_data`). Get Al's approval before running it.

For `simpro-mock` specifically, since its data is fully reproducible from `seed.py`:

```bash
docker compose stop simpro-mock simpro-mock-db
docker volume rm clive-i_simpro-mock-db-data   # volume name may vary; check `docker volume ls`
docker compose up -d simpro-mock-db simpro-mock
```

## 11. Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `simpro-mock` serves old code after an edit | Dockerfile bakes source at build time | `docker compose build simpro-mock` then `up -d`, not just a restart |
| `uv run ENV_VAR=... command` fails, tries to exec the env var | Argument order | Use `ENV_VAR=... uv run command` |
| `pip install -e ".[dev]"` warns "does not provide the extra 'dev'" | Root `pyproject.toml` uses `[dependency-groups]`, not `[project.optional-dependencies]` | Use `uv sync` |
| 401 from the mock | Missing/incorrect `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, or token doesn't match `SIMPRO_MOCK_MOCK_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Re-fetch a token from `/oauth2/token` |
