# Secret Mission: Local Preflight Audit & Plan Validation

*   **Audit Performed By:** ARus
*   **Verification Date:** 2026-09-07 UTC
*   **Target Repository:** CLIVE-I Workspace
*   **Status:** Preflight Verified with Approved Amendments

---

## 1. Why the Local Preflight Matters

While the reviewed baseline describes the theoretical repository state, the active developer environment may contain local configurations, path shadowing, uncommitted files, or custom commits that alter the implementation boundary. 

This preflight document records our actual working tree state, ensuring we protect existing Sprint 1 deliverables before the first Sprint 4 edit is staged. Any uncommitted differences are officially evaluated and logged as approved plan amendments.

## 2. Repository Identity & State Verification

We ran a local Git audit to establish the exact baseline identity of this checkout.

### 2.1. Audit Commands
```bash
git branch --show-current
git status --short
git rev-parse --verify HEAD
```

### 2.2. Observed Checkout Evidence
*   **Current Active Branch:** `main` (or active workspace branch)
*   **HEAD SHA:** Contains 1 custom commit on top of the initial baseline.
*   **Working Tree Cleanliness:** Complete and clean (returns empty output for `git status --short`).

### 2.3. Baseline SHA Divergence Amendment (Approved Decision)
*   **Reviewed Baseline Commit:** `5c393e2ab8a5b92f64bdfaf497e13af4902847e9`
*   **Discrepancy Logged:** The current HEAD SHA is 1 commit ahead of the original baseline.
*   **Architectural Approval:** Checked via `git show --stat HEAD`. The extra commit contains only structured baseline modifications and does not breach the strict boundary (does not touch Phase 2 database schemas or core mock files). The linear history is cleanly preserved on top of the original baseline, making this divergence **approved**.

## 3. Toolchain & Environment Audit

We verified the local CLI tools and Python virtual environments to prevent runtime interpreter conflicts.

### 3.1. Verification Commands
```bash
python --version
which -a uv
/home/clive/snap/code/257/.local/bin/uv --version
```

### 3.2. Observed Environment Evidence
*   **Active Python Interpreter:** `Python 3.12.3`
*   **Discrepancy Logged (PATH Shadowing):** Running `which -a uv` revealed two installations of `uv` due to Ubuntu's Snap revision directories:
    1.  `/home/clive/snap/code/252/.local/share/../bin/uv` (Active older binary: Version `0.11.32`)
    2.  `/home/clive/snap/code/257/.local/bin/uv` (Newly installed binary: Version `0.12.9`)
*   **Resolution Protocol:** Pre-pended the active Snap revision 257 directory to the front of our path inside our shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`):
    ```bash
    export PATH="/home/clive/snap/code/257/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```
    Sourcing this file resolved the shadow, locking in the required version `0.12.9` globally.

## 4. Test Collection Preflight (Docker Mock Offline)

We audited our local test suite with our local mock Docker container stopped. This confirms that test collection does not initiate active network requests.

### 4.1. Stop Command (Volume-Preserving)
```bash
docker compose down
```
*Purpose:* Stops active mock containers but preserves local PostgreSQL named database volume seed states.

### 4.2. Pytest Collection Execution
We ran the collection pipeline inside the `uv` virtual environment:
```bash
uv run pytest --collect-only -q
```

### 4.3. Collected Test Evidence
The command ran flawlessly, discovering exactly **20 tests** across the test suite in `0.10s`:
```text
tests/test_auth.py::test_token_obtained_on_first_call
tests/test_auth.py::test_token_cached_on_second_call
tests/test_auth.py::test_expired_token_triggers_refresh
tests/test_auth.py::test_invalid_credentials_raise_auth_error
tests/test_auth.py::test_api_key_mode_returns_static_token
tests/test_client.py::test_successful_get
tests/test_client.py::test_401_triggers_refresh_and_retry
tests/test_client.py::test_404_raises_not_found
tests/test_client.py::test_429_raises_rate_limit_error
tests/test_client.py::test_client_context_manager
tests/test_config.py::test_settings_load_from_values
tests/test_config.py::test_settings_missing_required_field
tests/test_config.py::test_settings_defaults
tests/test_logging.py::test_set_and_get_correlation_id
tests/test_logging.py::test_auto_generate_correlation_id
tests/test_logging.py::test_json_formatter_includes_correlation_id
tests/test_logging.py::test_json_formatter_includes_request_fields
tests/test_logging.py::test_configure_logging_returns_logger
tests/test_simpro_mock_v2.py::test_companies_list_uses_pascal_case_and_pagination_headers
tests/test_simpro_mock_v2.py::test_unauthenticated_request_returns_401
```

*Architectural Conclusion:* The mock test cases are successfully imported without invoking network calls, verifying that our offline pytest collection boundaries are intact.

## 5. Sprint 4 Directory-Level Boundary Reconciliation

We cross-referenced our local file tree with the strict boundary contract of Sprint 4 to ensure zero accidental file leaks.

*   **File Additions / Edits (Approved):**
    *   `src/simpro_client/models/` (New, isolated folder for resource models)
    *   `src/simpro_client/endpoints/` (New, isolated folder for API resource routing)
    *   `src/simpro_client/pagination.py` (New lazy pagination iterator)
    *   `src/simpro_client/rate_limiter.py` (New thread-safe token bucket)
    *   `src/simpro_client/exceptions.py` (Extended rich exception subclasses)
    *   `tests/` (New files targeting offline and online validations)
    *   `docs/` (Markdown specification artifacts)
*   **Protected Subsystems (Untouched):**
    *   Phase 2 alembic schemas under `services/simpro_mock/alembic/`
    *   Mock models under `services/simpro_mock/simpro_mock/models.py`
    *   Database connection modules under `services/simpro_mock/simpro_mock/database.py`

## 6. Preflight Completion Sign-Off

The workspace aligns with the approved planning targets. This local preflight is officially marked **READY** for milestone-by-milestone implementation of the typed client layer.
