# CLIVE Changelog

Reconstructed from `docs/scope/scope-rev2.md` (formerly `RevisedScope.txt`), chat history, and the current state of the codebase.

## Phase 1 — Local AI Platform
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS development host provisioned
- Docker Compose stack: Ollama + Open WebUI
- Local models pulled (`llama3.2`, `qwen2.5-coder:7b`)

## Phase 2 — Production RAG
- Added `postgres` service (`pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg16`), bound to `127.0.0.1` only
- Added `tika` service (`apache/tika:3.3.1.0-full`) for document extraction
- Configured Open WebUI to use PGVector + Tika + Ollama `nomic-embed-text` embeddings
- Enabled Hybrid Search (BM25 + vector + CrossEncoder reranking)
- Tuned chunking: 1000/100 → 1500/200 (chunk size / overlap)
- Added `scripts/backup.sh` (dump, compress, integrity/restore verification, rotation) and `scripts/verify.sh`

## Phase 3 — Simpro API Integration

### Sprint 1 — Client Foundation
- Created `src/simpro_client/` package (editable install, `pyproject.toml`)
- `config.py`: `SimproSettings` via `pydantic-settings`, `SIMPRO_` env prefix, `extra="ignore"`
- `auth.py`: `AuthManager` — OAuth2 Client Credentials with token caching/refresh, API Key fallback
- `client.py`: `SimproClient` base HTTP client — GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE, 401 retry-once, structured error handling
- `exceptions.py`: typed exception hierarchy (`SimproError`, `SimproAuthError`, `SimproAPIError`, `SimproRateLimitError`, `SimproNotFoundError`)
- `logging.py`: `ContextVar`-based correlation IDs, JSON log formatter, `RequestTimer`
- 18 unit tests added (`test_auth.py`, `test_client.py`, `test_config.py`, `test_logging.py`), respx-mocked, all offline

### Architecture Pivot (planning)
- Confirmed: no live Simpro Premium API access available to CVC
- Decision recorded (`docs/ADR/adr-mock-simpro-api.md`): build a high-fidelity mock service before the typed client layer, so only `SIMPRO_BASE_URL`/`SIMPRO_TOKEN_URL` need to change when live access arrives
- Confirmed OAuth strategy: Client Credentials Grant for the backend integration; Authorization Code Grant deferred to a future user-facing portal (Phase 6+)
- Confirmed multi-company model: `CVC Service` (`company_id=1`), `CVC Projects` (`company_id=2`)

### Sprint 3 — Simpro Mock Service
- Created `services/simpro_mock/` FastAPI service, own dedicated Postgres container (`simpro-mock-db`, port 5433), kept separate from the Phase 2 PGVector database
- Modelled and seeded 12 resources: Companies, Customers, Jobs, Quotes, Contacts, Sites, Assets, Employees, Projects, Job Notes, Attachments, Statuses
- Implemented `BearerAuthMiddleware`, Simpro-style operator filtering (`gt()`, `lt()`, `le()`, `ge()`, `ne()`, `between()`, `in()`, `!in()`, `search=all|any`), and pagination headers (`Result-Total`, `Result-Count`, `Result-Pages`)
- Alembic migrations (`876a0e057b67_init_db.py`, `27082026_add_simpro_resources.py`)
- Added to `docker-compose.yml` on port 8100
- ADR written: `docs/ADR/adr-mock-simpro-api.md`

### Sprint 3 Review / Hardening Fixes
- Rewrote the live-mock integration test as a properly skip-gated pytest module (`tests/test_simpro_mock_v2.py`), guarding on mock reachability rather than failing collection outright
- Moved the manual diagnostic script with `test_*`-named helper functions out of `tests/` to `scripts/verify-simpro-mock.py`, eliminating phantom pytest collection
- Fixed an unreachable branch in `client.py`'s correlation-ID handling; correlation IDs are now propagated on the outgoing `X-Correlation-ID` request header
- Normalized `simpro_mock/models.py` to consistent SQLAlchemy 2.0 `Mapped[]`/`mapped_column` style with `back_populates` on every relationship
- Normalized `simpro_mock/schemas.py` to consistent `str | None` typing (previously mixed with `Optional[str]`)
- Cleaned git history: untracked an accidentally committed `.venv/`, amended the Sprint 1 commit, force-pushed with `--force-with-lease`

### Documentation Catch-Up (2026-09-04)
- Added ADR-001 to ADR-009 and `docs/ADR/ADR-index.md`, the four PDDs (`docs/PDDs/`), `architecture.md`, `development-standards.md`, `installation.md`, `known-issues.md`, `roadmap.md`, `testing.md`, `simpro-mock-api-reference.md`, `docs/scope/scope-rev2.md` and this changelog
- Expanded the Phase 3 summary (then `docs/phase3.md`, now `docs/phase3/phase3-summary.md`)
- Removed the legacy script-style test `tests/test_simpro_mock.py`

### Sprint 4 — Typed Client Layer
Implemented with deviations from ADR-010; see `src/simpro_client/CLAUDE.md`.
- 2026-09-07: added ADR-010 (client-side resilience policy) and the Sprint 4 contract, preflight audit and architecture summary in `docs/phase3/`; moved the phase summaries into `docs/phase1/`, `docs/phase2/` and `docs/phase3/`
- 2026-09-17: added twelve typed Pydantic resource models (`src/simpro_client/models/`) and endpoint modules (`src/simpro_client/endpoints/`); `endpoints/base.py` provides `fetch_page()` for single-page requests; registered the `integration` pytest marker; added `tests/test_models.py`, `tests/test_endpoints.py` and `tests/test_route_contract.py`
- 2026-09-29: added `iter_all()` (iterates over all pages) to `endpoints/base.py`; added the token-bucket rate limiter (`src/simpro_client/rate_limiter.py`, settings `SIMPRO_LIMITER_CAPACITY` / `SIMPRO_LIMITER_REFILL_RATE`); `client.py` retries 429 responses up to `SIMPRO_MAX_RETRIES`; added `SimproClientError`, `SimproServerError` and `SimproProtocolError` to `exceptions.py`; added `tests/test_pagination.py`, `tests/test_rate_limiter.py` and `tests/test_retries.py`
- 2026-10-05: `docker-compose.yml`: `simpro-mock-db` credentials and `SIMPRO_MOCK_DATABASE_URL` come from the `.env` keys `SIMPRO_MOCK_DB_USER` / `_PASSWORD` / `_NAME` (required; `Settings.database_url` has no default); every published port binds to `127.0.0.1`; `simpro-mock` gained a `GET /health` healthcheck; unused named volumes removed
- 2026-10-05: `scripts/verify.sh` reads `.env` and also checks `simpro-mock-db` and `simpro-mock`
- 2026-10-06: `seed.py` produces identical data on every start on the same day (fixed `RANDOM_SEED`, timestamps anchored to midnight, re-read queries ordered by id)
- 2026-10-06: mock `Dockerfile` installs from `uv.lock` (`uv sync --locked`) in a build stage, runs as non-root user `app`, and pins `python:3.12.3-slim-bookworm`
- 2026-10-06: `client.py` retries GET requests on 502/503/504 and on timeouts/network errors, sharing the `SIMPRO_MAX_RETRIES` budget with 429 (ADR-010 §2.2); non-GET methods and other 5xx are not retried
- 2026-10-06: `AuthManager` token requests acquire from the client's `TokenBucket` (ADR-010 §2.1)
- 2026-10-06: added `SimproAuthRefreshError(SimproClientError, SimproAuthError)` to `exceptions.py`, raised when the token refresh after a 401 fails (ADR-010 §2.2)
- 2026-10-06: `SimproAuthError` carries optional `status_code` (token endpoint), `method`, `url` and `correlation_id`, filled in by the client (ADR-010 §2.4); `SimproAPIError` initialises its base first; drafted ADR-011 (Proposed) to correct the exception hierarchy in ADR-010 §2.5
- 2026-10-06: ADR-011 accepted; ADR-010 §2.5 superseded (Status line only). The `SimproAPIError` layer is no longer listed as a deviation
- 2026-10-06: `SimproSettings.auth_mode` is a `Literal["client_credentials", "api_key"]`, and a validator requires `client_id` + `client_secret` or `api_key` according to the mode (an empty value counts as missing); `client_id` / `client_secret` are now optional in `api_key` mode. `company_id_service` / `company_id_projects` documented as reserved. `client.py` gained type hints and docstrings (no behaviour change)
- 2026-10-06: ADR-012 accepted (supersedes ADR-010 §2.3, extends §2.1). `client.py` caps every retry sleep at the new `SIMPRO_MAX_RETRY_DELAY` setting (default 60.0), including a server-supplied `Retry-After`, which previously could block the calling thread for hours or raise an uncaught `OverflowError`; `SimproRateLimitError.retry_after` still reports the server's uncapped value
- 2026-10-07: `AuthManager` serialises token refreshes with a double-checked `threading.Lock`, so N concurrent callers make one token request between them instead of one each (previously eight threads produced eight requests and drained the shared limiter budget); `invalidate(token=None)` clears the cache only when it still holds that token, and `client.py` passes the token that received the 401 (ADR-012 §2.2)
- 2026-10-07: drafted ADR-013 (Proposed) to re-shape `simpro_mock` and `simpro_client` to Simpro's published OpenAPI 2.0 spec, after a diff against the official spec (719 paths, dated 2026-08-20, supplied by Al) showed that payloads generated from it fail validation for 11 of the 12 client models, and that 4 of 12 routes do not exist upstream; `adr-mock-simpro-api.md`'s "Capabilities & Coverage" section superseded (Status line only). Vendored the contract as `docs/contracts/simpro-openapi-v1-get-subset.json` (GET-only, 25 paths, 251 KB) with `scripts/prune-simpro-spec.py` to regenerate it; added `tests/test_spec_conformance.py` + `tests/spec_conformance_baseline.json` (40 known-nonconforming combinations, enforced in both directions so the file can only shrink) and `tests/test_client_mock_drift.py`, which drives the real `SimproClient` against the running mock and is the first test of any kind that the two packages can talk to each other. `src/simpro_client/CLAUDE.md` §7 repointed from the mock's schemas to the vendored contract. No `src/` or `services/` behaviour change in this sprint

## Not Yet Started


- Phase 3 → Phase 4 handoff decision (direct import vs. service wrapper): drafted as ADR-009 (Proposed), undecided
- Phase 4 (Document Generation) — blocked on the above
